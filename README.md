    Visualization of Dynamic Memory Allocation


    Functionalities:

        Given some assembly code that simulates the calls to malloc and free from a C program, the program simulates those calls calling allocate/ deallocate
    methods from the heap object that we created and return the position that those calls created. Then using the arcade library I created the window that shows the
