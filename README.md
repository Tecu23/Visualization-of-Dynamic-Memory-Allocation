Title: Visualization of Dynamic Memory Allocation


    Functionalities:

        Given some c code that uses multiple calls to malloc/calloc and free it emulates it using the unicorn engine and retrieves
    the memory location that was just allocated or freed to better understand the functionality of those calls.
