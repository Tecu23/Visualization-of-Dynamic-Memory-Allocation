    Title: 
    
    Visualization of Dynamic Memory Allocation


    Functionalities:

        - simulating the heap memory in a program 
        - seeing the allocation and deallocation of blocks in real-time
        - seeing the addreses where the memory has been allocated/freed and the size

    All to better understand how the memory is being used in a real program
